  abstract = {This report is based on the 2004 AGU Fall Meeting's session entitled “Special Focus: Advances in Data Acquisition, Management, Analysis and Display: Cyberinfrastructure for Earth Systems Science IV: Sensor Networks.” An environmental sensor network comprises an array of sensors that gather data autonomously and automatically forward the data to a central server. What differentiates modern sensor networks from previous techniques is an emphasis on “intelligence” in the sensor packages as well as the data network. Modern sensor networks also typically publish the data on the server to the World Wide Web and allow real-time access to the data. These networks require a unique combination of technological and environmental understanding, and have the potential of creating a revolution in environmental monitoring, similar in impact to satellite remote sensing in the 1970s.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The heterogeneous nature of urban environments means that atmospheric research ideally requires a dense network of sensors to adequately resolve the local climate. With recent advances in sensor technology, a number of urban meteorological networks now exist with a range of research or operational objectives. This article reviews and assesses the current status of urban meteorological networks, by examining the fundamental scientific and logistical issues related to these networks. The article concludes by making recommendations for future deployments based on the challenges encountered by existing networks, including the need for better reporting and documentation of network characteristics, standardized approaches and guidelines, along with the need to overcome financial barriers via collaborative relationships in order to establish the long-term urban networks essential for advancing urban climate research.

  abstract     = {There is a growing need for meteorological data in urban areas in support of air pollution research and management, but measurement poses substantial challenges. Most densely-developed sites make it impossible to conform to the standard WMO Guidelines for site selection and instrument exposure (WMO, 1996) due to obstruction of airflow and radiation exchange by buildings and trees, unnatural surface cover and waste heat and water vapour from human activities. New guidelines (Oke, 2004) to assist in this task form the basis of the first part of this paper. Here emphasis is on those variables of greatest use in air pollution applications. Valid and repeatable results can be obtained despite the heterogeneity of cities, but it requires careful attention to principles and concepts specific to urban areas. Guidelines must be applied intelligently and flexibly, rigid `rules' have little utility. It is necessary to consider exposures over non-standard surfaces at non-standard heights, splitting observations between more than one location, or being closer to buildings or anthropogenic heat and vapour sources than is normal WMO recommended practice.},

Unfortunately, most of these APIs do not come with any specification that developers (and machines) can rely on to automatically understand and integrate them. Instead, most of the time we have to rely on reading its ad-hoc documentation web pages, despite the existence of languages like Swagger or, more recently, OpenAPI that developers could use to formally describe their APIs. In this paper we present an example-driven discovery process that generates model-based OpenAPI specifications for REST Web APIs by using API call examples. A tool implementing our approach and a community-driven repository for the discovered APIs are also presented.},
